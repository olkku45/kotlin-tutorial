# A tutorial for the programming language Kotlin

This is a Kotlin programming tutorial made as a learning project. Now, before anything else, I'm going to assume you have learned the
basics of programming in some other language, so: variables, loops, functions, conditionals and collections. I'm going to go less in depth about these 
things, and more in depth on OOP programming, since that's something I'm not quite used to myself (at the time of writing this), and because 
Kotlin is a pretty OOP-heavy language, at least I've heard so. I'm going to compare some things to their equivalents in the language Python, and also
make remarks about how some things are different compared to Python. The reason for using Python as a comparison point is that personally, I only
have done programming using it, and also since this is a learning project. This tutorial includes exercises that I recommend you do, but they're not 
mandatory, and I have no way of checking if you have actually done them. Do them in your code editor of choice.
